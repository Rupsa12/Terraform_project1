>>> here we will use variable for 
	1. region
	2. ami (mentioned as ami-map)

>>> the default value for region is here "us-east-1"

>>> in terraform.tfvars file we will only give extra value for region variable "us-west-2"

>>> for another variable "ami-map"
	1. we are using here the type of variable map(string) [map(string) is a type of datatype] which is required for lookup function
	2. variable "ami_map" {
  				type = map(string)
  				default = {
    				"us-east-1"     = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
    				"us-west-2"     = "ami-0abcdef1234567890"
    				"eu-central-1"  = "ami-0c1234abcd5678efg"
  				}

>>> Now, come to the main.tf file. 
		
	1. provider "aws" {
  				region = var.region     ... [now if we run this which value it will take? here we need to think of variable precedence, value of .tfvars > default value]
  				access_key = "xyz"
  				secret_key = "xyz"
			   }

	

	2. resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  						ami = lookup(var.ami_map, var.region, "ami-defaultfallback")
  						instance_type = "t2.micro"

 						 tags = {
    							Name = "WebServer-${var.region}"
  							}
					}
		
		now, here the lookup function syntax is lookup({map,key,default value})
					so map here = go to point no.2


>>>>>>> so output calculated here is
		1. for lookup function, var.ami_map = go to point no.2  
		2. key = "us-west-2" [variable precedence, value of .tfvars > default value]
		3. "ami-defaultfallback" = its not executed cause the var.region value present in Map variable. 
			if, you give it other than any of those three regions i.e "ap-south-1" , it will give "ami-defaultfallback" as an output.
